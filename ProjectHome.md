Almost all of the shopping carts available on the web run server side and therefore require server side scripting languages. In some cases the institution providing your secure credit card handling may provide you with access to a server side shopping cart that runs off of their servers. In other cases you have to implement the shopping cart on your own site. This is all very well when you have your own secure server and access to the appropriate server side scripting language but what can you do when you need a shopping cart but don't have access to either a secure server or server side scripting?

One alternative is to use a hosted e-commerce shopping cart software solution.

Another possible answer is to use a shopping cart written in JavaScript that runs right there in your visitor's browser.
